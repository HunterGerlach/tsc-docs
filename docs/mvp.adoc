== Development Practices

=== AWS Infrastructure

=== Red Hat Product Demonstration System (RHPDS)

RHPDS provides a simple way to spin up your own OpenShift cluster on AWS upon which you can deploy tools, develop pipelines / code, etc. If you haven't used RHPDS before, begin by visiting the https://www.opentlc.com/account[OpenTLC Account Setup Page] to activate your account or reset your password.

==== Creating an OCP Cluster on RHPDS

. Visit https://rhpds.redhat.com[RHPDS] and login using your OpenTLC credentials. Your userid will be in the format _<redhatuserid>-redhat.com_. 
+
. Once logged in, make sure you switch to the _Employee_ Group.
+
image::dev-practices/rhpds-change-group.png[RHPDS Change Group]
+
. Select *Services* -> *Catalogs* -> *Workshops* -> *OpenShift 4.x Workshop*
+
image::dev-practices/rhpds-services-catalogs.png[RHPDS Services Catalog]
+
image::dev-practices/rhpds-workshop.png[RHPDS OCP 4 Workshop]
+
. Click the *Order* button and fill out the requested information in the form, example below. Note that the default environment lifetime is 2 Days, however it can be extended once.
+
image::dev-practices/rhpds-form.png[RHPDS Workshop Request Form]
+
. Click the _Submit_button and wait for the final email stating that your environment was successfully provisioned. Use the credentials provided to access your OCP cluster.
+
Since the cluster is ephemeral, automating your workloads can be quite valuable. Informally, the information provided by the final provisioning email can be used to spring-board ansible deployments into the environment. For example if the bastion host is *bastion.set-demo-1234.example.opentlc.com*:
+
```
export BASTION=bastion.set-demo-1234.example.opentlc.com
export ANSIBLE_USER=userid-redhat.com
mkdir rhpds_ansible
cd rhpds_ansible

# Configure the ansible inventory file
echo "${BASTION} ansible_user=${ANSIBLE_USER}" > hosts

# Copy yout local public key to the bastion for passwordless ssh
ssh-copy-id -o PreferredAuthentications=password ${ANSIBLE_USER}@${BASTION}

# Verify connectivity
ansible -i hosts all -a "oc get nodes"
```
+
At this point a playbook or role can be developed to deploy your workloads.  Review the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/k8s_module.html[ansible k8s module] for more flexibility, as this is the module used for creating ansible based operators.
+
More formally, the https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd[Ansible Agnostic Deployer] framework is used by RHPDS to deploy its labs. Content can be contributed back and any developed https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible/roles[roles] can potentially be added as catalog items for RHPDS.
